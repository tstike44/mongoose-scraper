# mongoose-scraper
* This application uses cheerio and mongoose to scrape a website and store it into our database.
* The design is for us to scrape a new site of our choosing and return the title, a small description of what the article is about, and a link to the original article.
* In this application the user is able to scroll through unique articles and select the "save article" which will allow them to keep track of articles they would like to refer to at a later time.
* The application will also allow the user to save a not attached to the article they have saved in order to keep a personalized message of why they saved this article (this is all user preference). The note can always be deleted at a later date.
